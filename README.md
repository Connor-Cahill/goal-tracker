# Goal Tracking 
This application is deployed and live at: https://calm-scrubland-29958.herokuapp.com

This was an application built with a node/express backend that utilizes handlebars as the view engine. All styling is done with vanilla CSS and JS.

Within the app a user can login or create an account and then start logging goals. On every goal a user can log action item, which are essentially todos to help you track what you need to do to achieve your goal. A user can also add updates to a goal. Updates help you log progress and what efforts you have been putting in to achieve your goal.
